# ObjectAugmentationAlgorithm

## Background
This algorithm was developed to the critical need for diverse and comprehensive data focused on human arm joint torques
while performing activities of daily living (ADL). Previous studies have often overlooked the influence of objects on joint
torques during ADL, resulting in limited datasets for analysis. To address this gap, we propose an Object Augmentation
Algorithm (OAA) capable of augmenting existing marker-based databases with virtual object motions and object-induced
joint torque estimations. The OAA consists of five phases:
- 1 computing hand coordinate systems from optical markers
- 2 characterising object movements with virtual markers
- 3 calculating object motions through inverse kinematics (IK)
- 4 determining the wrench necessary for prescribed object motion using inverse dynamics (ID)
- 5 computing joint torques resulting from object manipulation.

## Validation 
The algorithmâ€™s accuracy was validated through trajectory tracking and torque analysis on a 7+4 degree of freedom (DoF) robotic hand-arm
system, manipulating three unique objects. The results showed that the OAA can accurately and precisely estimate 6 DoF object motion 
and object-induced joint torques. Correlations between computed and measured quantities were > 0.99 for object trajectories and > 0.93 
for joint torques. The OAA was further shown to be robust to variations in the number and placement of input markers,
which are expected between databases. Differences between repeated experiments were minor but significant (p < 0.05). 
The algorithm expands the scope of available data and facilitates more comprehensive analyses of human-object interaction dynamics

# Workflow
The algorithm uses the OpenSim4.4 Api to compute inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics.
## 0. Set data path
Inside the example notebook, the absolute path to the data directory of the repository on you system must be set.

## 1. Prepare MoCap data
This is the data of the human trial. 
- Required markers: Elbow, Wrist (Radial and Ulnar styloids), Hand (minimum 3 markers)
- Dataformat: .trc format
- Orientation: must match with the OpenSim coordinate frame of the object model. This is important for the correct direction of gravity

## 2. Compute hand coordinate frames
For each input marker frame, a hand coordnate frame is computed, which will be later used to place virtual objects inside the hand.

## 3. Make object models
Create an OpenSim model of the object being manipulated in human trials.

## 4 Generate Object Kinematics
First trajectories of virtual object markers are computed from hand coordinate frames, by placing object markers (3 for each rigid object) within each hand 
frame that describe the location and orientation of the object to be simulated. For example, a can could be placed such that it is centrally
grasped in the hand. For this markers at the cans CoM, top and somewhere at the circumference could be chosen.

Second object motion is computed from virtual object markers via inverse kinematics with the OpenSim inverse kinematics solver.

## 5 Generate Object Dynamics
The object model and object motion computed in the previos step are used to compute the wrench necessary to move objects along the prescribed trajectory via
inverse dynamics with the OpenSim inverse dynamics tool.

## 6 Simulate Object Manipulation
The inverse dynamics result can be used in an external loads file, to apply the object wrench to the hand of the subject, which effectively simulates object manipulation.

# Dependencies
numpy, scipy, pickle, plotly, OpenSim4.4 api for python

## Install OpenSim 4.4 for Python in windows
1. delete previous OpenSim versions from path or at least move below opensim 4.4
2. Download the Anaconda environment file (conda_env.yml) https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8443/download/attachments/29165295/conda_env.yml?version=1&modificationDate=1643835525076&api=v2 and place it in a directory of your choice (conveniently in C:\OpenSim4.4\sdk\Python). There is a copy of this file inside this repo too.
3. open an Anaconda powershell
4. conda init cmd.exe
5. cd C:\OpenSim4.4\sdk\Python
6. conda env create -f conda_env.yml
7. conda activate opensim_scripting
8. python setup_win_python38.py (it is here C:\OpenSim4.4\sdk\Python)
9. python -m pip install . ( the dot is important)
10. step necessary on some machines: conda install - opensim-org opensim
11. to use OpenSim 4.4 in a python script there must be the following lines before importing opensim:
    import os
    os.add_dll_directory("C:/OpenSim4.4/bin") # or however the location is called on your PC

## Common errors with the OpenSim Api
- module _simbody not found:
    follow the installation instructions above. Has os.add_dll_directory("C:/OpenSim4.4/bin") been added to the script?
  
- scale tool doesnt work
    use the absolute path to required files. Otherwise the tool returns an error

- InverKinematicsSolver throws an error that the number or type of input is wrong:
    this is probably because you are using OpenSim 4.2 and the c++ is expecting a pointer
    I couldn't solve this problem. Use openSim 4.4 as that function implements call by value as well

- RuntimeError: std::exception in 'bool OpenSim::InverseDynamicsTool::run()': InverseDynamicsTool Failed, please see messages window for details...
    check the ID settings file. Is there a model name or does the field say unassigned?
    If the xml file was created by the GUI then the file will be unassigned and the solver does not know which model to load

- AttributeError: module 'os' has no attribute 'add_dll_directory'
    are you using the correct environment? OpenSim44? This error usually occurs if opensim is not installed in that environment
